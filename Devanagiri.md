# Devanagiri

Unicode is the standard way to store Devanagari, and virtually every other script, in digital media. Devanagari is the traditional alphabet for writing Sanskrit and certain other Indian languages.
The Devanagari portion of Unicode has a code for each Devanagari letter, according to the traditional Panini conception of letter. Since Devanagari letters combine in a complex way not found in Western scripts, Unicode fonts that include Devanagari have information about combining simple characters into compound characters. Programs that use these fonts must be able to handle this information correctly.
